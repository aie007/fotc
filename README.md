#### Description:
In this Project weâ€™ve created a smart map with Bing Maps API with Python.We are developing of a centralized platform with web-based portal for storing and sharing of information about accessible buildings,public places,offices. The system will also store their physical locations so that the information can also be shown on a on-screen map. The system will store and share information about the accessibility features viz. provisions of ramps, handrails, accessible toilets, Braille signage, accessible counters, lifts, wheelchairs etc. The system will store and share photographs and videos of such places. Registration of accessible buildings or locations by the owners (private & Government both). Display of information to the disabled persons as per search criteria on a map based platform, like google map.
